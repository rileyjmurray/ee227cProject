@article{gwFirstMaxCutSDP,
abstract = {We present randomized approximation algorithms for the maximum cut (MAX CUT) and maximum 2-satisfiability (MAX 2SAT) problems that always deliver solutions of expected value at least .87856 times the optimal value. These algorithms use a simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization problem. The best previously known approximation algorithms for these problems had performance guarantees of 1/2 for MAX CUT and 3/4 for MAX 2SAT. Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a .79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a .758-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT, where the best previously known approximation algorithms had performance guarantees of 1/4 and 3/4, respectively. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms.},

@article{AsanoAndWilliamson2002,
abstract = {MAX SAT (the maximum satisfiability problem) is stated as follows: given a set of clauses with weights, find a truth assignment that maximizes the sum of the weights of the satisfied clauses. In this paper, we consider approximation algo- rithms for MAX SAT proposed by Goemans and Williamson and present a sharp- ened analysis of their performance guarantees. We also show that these algorithms, combined with recent approximation algorithms for MAX 2SAT, MAX 3SAT, and MAX SAT due to Feige and Goemans, Karloff and Zwick, and Zwick, respectively, lead to an improved approximation algorithm for MAX SAT. By using the MAX 2SAT and 3SAT algorithms, we obtain a performance guarantee of 0.7846, and by using Zwick’s algorithm, we obtain a performance guarantee of 0.8331, which improves upon the performance guarantee of 0.7977 based on Zwick’s conjecture. The best previous result for MAX SAT without assuming Zwick’s conjecture is a 0.770-approximation algorithm of Asano. Our best algorithm requires a new fam- ily of 3 4 -approximation algorithms that generalize a previous algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. ©},

@article{Trevisan2000,
abstract = {We present a linear programming-based method for finding "gadgets," i.e., combinatorial structures reducing constraints of one optimization problem to constraints of another. A key step in this method is a simple observation which limits the search space to a finite one. Using this new method we present a number of new, computer-constructed gadgets for several different reductions. This method also answers a question posed by Bellare, Goldreich, and Sudan [SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 804--915] of how to prove the optimality of gadgets: linear programming duality gives such proofs. The new gadgets, when combined with recent results of H\aa stad [ Proceedings of the 29th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1997, pp. 1--10], improve the known inapproximability results for MAX CUT and MAX DICUT, showing that approximating these problems to within factors of \$16/17 + \backslash epsilon\$ and \$12/13+ \backslash epsilon,\$ respectively, is NP-hard for every \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$. Prior to this work, the best-known inapproximability thresholds for both problems were 71/72 (M. Bellare, O. Goldreich, and M. Sudan [ SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 804--915]). Without using the gadgets from this paper, the best possible hardness that would follow from Bellare, Goldreich, and Sudan and H\aa\{s\}tad is \$18/19\$. We also use the gadgets to obtain an improved approximation algorithm for MAX3 SAT which guarantees an approximation ratio of .801. This improves upon the previous best bound (implicit from M. X. Goemans and D. P. Williamson [ J. ACM, 42 (1995), pp. 1115--1145]; U. Feige and M. X. Goemans [ Proceedings of the Third Israel Symposium on Theory of Computing and Systems, 1995, pp. 182--189]) of .7704.},
