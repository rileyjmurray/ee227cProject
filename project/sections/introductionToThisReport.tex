The aims of the report are threefold.  (1) Introduce the reader to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework. (2) Equip the reader with ``tractable tools" from convex optimization (and randomized algorithms) to find a ``good" solution. This is done in a wholesome fashion since we don't leave for the reader to implement the schemes but in fact demonstrate them in our numerical section. (3) Introduce some of the optimal approximation schemes in literature and comment on their computational aspects.

With regards to introducing the reader to Constraint Satisfaction Problems, we note that different communities mean different things by ``Constraint Satisfaction Problem". Our definition is motivated by recent developments in approximation algorithms for certain combinatorial problems. Once we have clearly specified the CSP framework, we provide a brief overview the Unique Games Conjecture, and how it connects to approximating CSP's.

Once the CSP framework and its relation to the Unique Games Conjecture is established, we present a tractable linear programming relaxation with a valuable probabilistic interpretation. The probabilistic interpretation of the LP is crucial in understanding a subsequent SDP formulation, \textit{but we present the SDP first without this interpretation} (we believe that doing so makes it easier to understand how to specify the SDP to a software package like CVX). The majority of this report is dedicated to SDP relaxations for CSP's.
